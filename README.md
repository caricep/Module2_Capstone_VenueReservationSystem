# Module 2 Capstone - Venue Reservation System
Completed during Week 6 of Tech Elevator. Designed and implemented a venue reservation system through pair programming and utilizing the DAO Pattern. The application interacted with users via a console interface allowing them to search for and reserve available spaces at various venues. Constraints were enforced based on space availability and users received a confirmation with venue space details along with a calculated total cost for the reservation. Developed integration tests for verification.
